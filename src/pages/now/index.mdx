## What I'm doing now, inspired by Derek Sivers

**Location:** Banbridge, Northern Ireland.

**Work:** Trying to become a better analyst at Zapier.

**Outside:** Shaving multiple yaks as I circle around starting to write for "fun" again. Hence the all-new AH.com, [Simple Analytical](https://simepleanalytical.com) getting shut down and a new home for [Analysts Assemble](https://analystsassemble.com)

**Play:** Sorted the tires on my bike out for the first time in years so I can slowly lap around the estate with the kids.

**TV:** Watching ER all the way through from the start - we're currently ready to start Season 5.

**Music:** The sounds of Laurel Canyon after watching the excellent recent documentary.

**Reading:** I have been terrible when it comes to reading anything other than the daily doomscroll of Twitter. Still have more of Stephen King's "If It Bleeds" to work my way through.

**Football:** Blessed relief as the English Premier League season is over and I can relax without THFC-related blood pressure issues until the middle of September.
